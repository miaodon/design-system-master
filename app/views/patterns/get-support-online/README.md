## When to use this pattern

Use this component at the bottom of every page of your service.

Some services, for example the SSCS ‘Submit Your Appeal’, have to be completed in one session. These users will need more instant support, in which case the web form may not be the most appropriate. Instead, just a phone number will suffice here (or web chat if available).

Each service will need to determine the best combination of help channels they offer to users. They will also need to determine the response time. E.g. the pattern shows 10 working days for CMC. Each service will be different.

## How it works

When a user needs help they can choose between making a call and completing an online form. The contents of the online form, along with additional data, such as the page url, date, time etc. are routed through to a customer service agent who can triage the issue and respond quickly to the user if required.

Implementing this pattern requires an agreement of where the issue will be routed, who will read it, respond to it, and the time frame within which they will respond.

## Research on this component

This pattern has been through several design crits. We'll update this section once it's been tested with users.
