Help users perform an action using one of the following:

- buttons in the [identity bar](/components/identity-bar)
- buttons in the [page heading](/components/page-header-with-actions)
- buttons within the body

## Identity bar

<video role="region" aria-label="Identity action buttons, this video has no audio." controls muted>
  <source src="/public/videos/identity-bar-actions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### When to use the identity bar

Use the identity bar for action buttons when the user may need to take action from any page within the particular entity.

### When not to use the identity bar

Some actions should only be shown for the specific page. For example, when adding a question or uploading a document to the case file. In these cases you should use the page heading with actions or buttons within the body.

## Page heading with actions

<video role="region" aria-label="Page header action buttons, this video has no audio." controls muted>
  <source src="/public/videos/page-header-actions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### When to use the page heading with actions

Use the page heading with actions when the user needs to perform an action relating to a specific section of a system but doesn't specifically relate to anything within the page.

In the example above the user is adding a new document to the case file but not performing an action against the document in view.

### When not to use the page heading with actions

You shouldn't use the page heading with actions if you:

- need to help users perform the same action across several sub sections. In this case use the identity bar.
- users are performing actions against a component within the page. See below for an example of this for asking questions.

## Buttons within the body

<video role="region" aria-label="In-page action buttons, this video has no audio." controls muted>
  <source src="/public/videos/in-page-actions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### When to use the buttons within the page

Use buttons within the page when the action is being taken against a particular component within the page. For example

### Button placement: above or below?

You should first left align buttons underneath the component they relate to. When adding items to a long list consider placing it [above the list](/patterns/filter-a-list) so that users don't have to scroll beyond the list to take the same action again.

## Removing distraction when within a flow

When taking an action (creating, editing etc), users should be taken to a new page with as much of the screen paraphernalia removed as possible including the original list of items.

A back link should be placed at the top left of the flow. Don't use a cancel link next to the Continue button.

## Repeat use actions

If the user has to perform the same action many times within a single session, adding an item should end by taking the user back to where they started with a [success message](/components/alert) at the top of the page.

## Infrequent or dangerous actions

If the user is performing an important action or if that action is taken infrequently, show users a [check answers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers) page followed by a [confirmation page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages).

## Actions versus navigation items

Don't put actions inside the [primary navigation](/components/primary-navigation) or [sub navigation](/components/sub-navigation) components.

## Research on this component

This pattern is used for many journeys throughout JUI and PUI and has tested well so far.
