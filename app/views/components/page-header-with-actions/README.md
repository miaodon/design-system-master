Use this when the page has a number of actions the user can take.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'page-header-with-actions',
  example: 'default',
  height: 175
})}}

## When to use this component

This component is most suited when:

1. the content of the page is so long that users have to scroll past a lot of content to see the actions. For example, having a “Create case” button underneath a long list of cases.

2. the action is applied to the page item in question and not any one specific part of the content. For example, in a user profile page, it makes sense to use this component for the “Suspend user” action.

## When not to use this component

Don't place buttons next to the header when they are specific to a component within the page.

## How it works

The component ensures the buttons are aligned right in line with the heading. On small screens the buttons tuck underneath the heading.
