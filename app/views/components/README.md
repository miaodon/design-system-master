# Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different [patterns](/patterns) and contexts. For example, the [timeline](/components/timeline) component can be used at the side of the page or on a page of its own in full.

If you are using [HMCTS Frontend](https://github.com/hmcts/frontend) in your prototype kit or in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design System.

See all the [components in the backlog](https://github.com/hmcts/design-system-backlog/issues).
