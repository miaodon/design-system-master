Use the Header component for any service or system not hosted on GOV.UK such as those for the judiciary or HMCTS staff.

Do not use this for citizen-facing services.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'header',
  example: 'default',
  height: 150
})}}

## How it works

The name of the service or system appears in the top left.

You can add global links to the top right which is useful for “Account” and “Sign out”.
