Use the Menu component to group buttons together in a row or collapsible menu.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'default',
  height: 175
})}}

## When to use this component

Use this component when the there are a number of possible actions the user can take.

## When not to use this component

Don't use this component when a basic in-page form has multiple actions.

## How it works

By default this component just groups buttons together to ensure they are spaced correctly. But can be turned into a toggle menu at a configurable screen width that:

- is aligned right or left
- is coloured green (primary) or grey (secondary)

### Left aligned grey toggle menu

Use the grey clour when it's not the main action the user needs to take.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible',
  height: 250
})}}

### Right aligned green toggle menu

Use the green colour when it's the main action the user needs to take.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible2',
  height: 250
})}}
