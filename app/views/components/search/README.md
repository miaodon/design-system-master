Let users search by word or phrase. This can also be used in within [Primary Navigation](/components/primary-navigation) component.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'search',
  example: 'default',
  height: 200
})}}

## How it works

You can configure the search form to be inversed on black and to hide and show labels and hints depending on your use case. You'll see examples of this on the [Primary Navigation](/components/primary-navigation) component page.
