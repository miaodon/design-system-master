## When to use this component

Progress bars are used at the entry and exit points of a transaction to illustrate the user's location within a larger service journey.

When a user completes a transaction, the <a href="">done page</a> should include a progress bar. When a user is invited to return to complete another transaction within the service journey, the <a href="">landing page</a> should also include a progress bar.

## When not to use this component

Progress bars are not used to show individual steps within a transaction, or used as a navigation within a transaction.
