## When to use this component

This component is helpful when an entity consists of additional [sub sections](/components/sub-navigation/).

## When not to use this component

Don't use this component if there's only one details page. For example, clicking a case in a case list and seeing a single page of information about the case.

## Action menu

You can optionally configure the component to display actions that the user can take from within any sub section.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'identity-bar',
  example: 'menu',
  height: 175
})}}

## Drop down action menu

The action menu uses the [Menu](/components/menu) component which can be configured to show as a drop down menu.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'identity-bar',
  example: 'toggle-menu',
  height: 275
})}}
