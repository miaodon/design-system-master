The content design team manage and update the HMCTS style guide.

## Updating the style guide

When content is designed for services it goes through a rigorous process to ensure it is appropriate, accurate and easty to understand. It is:
 - drafted in plain English or clearer language
 - tested with users
 - reviewed by policy, legal experts or the judiciary
 - peer-reviewed by other content designers
 - reviewed by GDS (when presented as part of an assessment)

Once the content has been validated by these checks, it is then discussed by the team and the style guide and A-Z are updated.

If you have a suggestion for the style guide, email the [content design team](contentdesigners-reform@HMCTS.NET).
