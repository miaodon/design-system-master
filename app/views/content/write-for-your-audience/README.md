Your audience is anyone uses an HMCTS service to complete a task. 

They might have used an HMCTS service before, or they may be completely new to the courts and tribunal system.

They could be a member of the public or e an expert who is representing a member of the public, for example a legal adviser.

## Writing for citizens
Our services are linked from GOV.UK mainstream content. They allow users to do something - apply for something, submit an appeal, respond to a claim.

Our users want to complete these tasks quickly and easily. We need to give them all the information to do this. You should:

 - provide only the information users need to complete the task, no more
 - only ask users for the minimum amount of information (for example, if you do not need someone’s address do not ask for it)
 - get the information you need using the least number of questions possible
  - break down complicated tasks into steps that help users to focus on one thing at a time
 - use common language and terms
 - keep one action per page

####Using legal content
You can still write legal content in plain English. It’s important that users understand content and that we present complicated information simply. 

They may have heard a term, but do not know what it means, so in many cases it is useful to mention the term and then spell it out in plain English. For example: An update to the will ('codicil').

Be careful of legal terms which users might have a vague understanding of, for example ‘hearing’, ‘the court’, ‘expert witness’. You may find that the meaning of these differs from user to user so you should make it clear what your service means.

### Writing for expert user audiences 

HMCTS expert users (legal experts, the judiciary and staff) often use technical language. 

If you need to use technical terms in your service, you can. They’re not jargon. 

You should just explain what they mean the first time you use them. Use the language that your users use - for civilians this is plain English, but for specialists it may be more technical. 

If you’re writing for a specialist audience, you still need to make sure everyone can understand what the content is about. So, you need to follow the recommendations about writing for citizens. 


### Writing for the web
We follow industry and accessibility good practice, which is all fully explained in the GDS content writing guidelines.
