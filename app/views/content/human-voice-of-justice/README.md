HMCTS has produced the human voice of justice - guidance on how to communicate, and how to write. 

This information is taken from the documents: 


The justice system can be daunting and confusing. Complex policies, official procedures, legal language and jargon can make people feel ‘processed’, whether they’re going through the system or work within it.

That’s why it’s important that we communicate in a caring, human way.

Communicating in a human way shows we’re a modern organisation that treats people as individuals, not numbers. It shows we really listen to our users and act on what they tell us. And when we communicate to each other in a human way, it makes HMCTS an open, supportive place
to work.

This guide explains how you can be the human voice of justice. It’s not a list of rules. It’s a useful approach you can apply every time you communicate, whether it’s with the people we serve or the people you work with.

## The three commitments

There are three commitments behind the human voice of justice:
					
1. We’ll listen to you
2. We’ll explain everything clearly 
3. We’ll guide you
					
This approach helps us to express the values we all share at the Ministry of Justice, those of purpose, humanity, openness and togetherness.
