Our services are on GOV.UK which gets over 50 million visits a month. There’s no guarantee that only your intended audience will find your content. 

So, it’s important we make our content as easy to understand as possible. Do this, by ensuring content is:
 - specific
 - informative
 - clear and concise 
 - serious but not pompous
 - emotionless (adjectives can be subjective and make the text sound more like spin)

(Adapted from the GOV.UK style guide.)

### Find out what they need to know
People using HMCTS digital services are trying to complete a task. So, your content needs to clearly tell them what they need to know or do to complete that task. 

In order to fully understand what your users need, you should:

 - carry out research with your service user groups
 - identify what your users need to know (their needs)
 - structure your content to provide the answers to meet those needs
 - find out the language they use and understand
 
### Use language they understand
Write content that makes sense to your audience:

 - use the language that they use - find this out by listening to research and testing, reading user feedback, finding out common search terms (use Google analytics and Google Trends)
 - use contractions like you’ll and we’ll (avoid negative contractions like can’t if you find your users struggle with them)
 - write in short sentences, avoid sentences with more than 25 words - break them up to make the content more clear
 - avoid words ending in ‘–ion’ and ‘–ment’ as they tend to make longer and more complicated sentences

You can use programmes like Hemingway to test if your content is easy to read.
