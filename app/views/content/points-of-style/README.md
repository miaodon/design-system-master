## Abbreviations and acronyms
 
Do not use full points in abbreviations, or spaces between initials, including those in proper names: IMF, mph, eg, 4am, M&S, No 10, AN Wilson, WH Smith, etc.
 
Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as awol, laser and, more recently, asbo, pin number and sim card. Note that pdf and plc are lowercase.
 
If an abbreviation or acronym is to be used more than once in a piece, put it in brackets at first mention: so Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), seasonal affective disorder (Sad); alternatively, use the abbreviation with a brief description, eg the conservation charity the RSPB. If an organisation is mentioned only once, don’t give its abbreviation or acronym.
 
Remember that our international readers may not be aware of UK abbreviations. 

Cap up single letters in such expressions as C-list, F-word, “the word assassin contains four Ss”, etc


## Active voice

Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.

## Addressing the user

Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action, eg ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’.

## Capitalisation

DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT. IT’S HARD TO READ.
## Colons

Avoid using colons in sentences. If you need to use one, don’t capitalize the first word after the colon unless it’s a proper noun. 
Use colons on running in sentences to introduce bullets.

## Contractions

Use contractions like you’ll and we’ll. Some organisations are reluctant to use contractions, but they are less formal and in testing we have found that users understand positive contractions.

Avoid negative contractions like can’t and don’t - unless your testing shows that your users understand them.  The GOV.UK style guide says research shows that many users find them harder to read, or misread them as the opposite of what they say.


## Date ranges

Use ‘to’ instead of a dash or slash in date ranges. ‘To’ is quicker to read than a dash, and it’s easier for screen readers.

Always explain what your date range represents, eg ‘tax year 2013 to 2014’ or ‘September 2013 to July 2014’. Date ranges can be the academic year, calendar year or tax year. This is why date ranges must be very, very clear.

If you’re comparing statistics from 2 different tax or financial years, use ‘Comparing the financial year ending 2011 with that ending 2012, there was a 9% decrease’.


## Gender-neutral text

Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Use ‘them’, ‘their’, ‘they’ etc.

## Links

Front-load your link text with the relevant terms and make them active and specific. Always link to online services first. Offer offline alternatives afterwards (where possible).

## Plain English

Plain English is mandatory for all of GOV.UK. One of the parts most people pick up on is the plain English (or words to avoid) list.

This is not just a list of words to avoid. Plain English is the whole ethos of GOV.UK: it’s a way of writing.

## Writing about disability

Words to use and avoid when writing about disability.

## When to use ‘we’

Using ‘we’ is fine, as long as you’re making it clear as much as possible who the ‘we’ is. Do not assume the audience will know. Each time you use ‘we’, make sure you’ve already used the full name of the department or agency in that specific section.
