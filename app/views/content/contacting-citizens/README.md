HMCTS contacts citizens by letter, email and text message. For users and our brand, we use standard salutations and sign-off content.

## The sender

Letters are printed on letterhead. Emails and text messages should be sent from HM Courts & Tribunals Service.


## Addressing users

In emails and letters, use:

>Dear First name Last name,

Do not ask users for their title unless there is another business need. You don't need to address the recipient by name in a text message.

## Letter sign-off

Unless citizens need to reply to a named person or department, for example 'The Probate Registry', sign off with:

>From,
>HM Courts & Tribunals Service


## Email sign-off

Keep this short - it should never be longer than the message.

If you have a contact us page in your service, direct users to it. It should have all the details and is a single place to make changes. Give citizens comfort by displaying the full link.

Unless emails need to be from a named person or department, our standard email sign-off is:

>From,
>HM Courts & Tribunals Service

>Please don't reply to this email. If you need to contact us, go to https://full-link/contact.

If users already have a reference, you could add a reminder to use it:

>Please don't reply to this email. If you need to contact us, go to https://full-link/contact. Remember to include your reference.
