HMCTS contacts citizens by letter, email and text message. For users and our brand, we need to use a standard greeting, tone and sign-off.

## How we write

Letters, emails and text messages must use a consistent tone. We write using [the human voice of justice](/content/human-voice-of-justice). You'll also find plain english translations in [the HMCTS A-Z](/content/hmcts-a-z).

GOV.UK has additional [guidelines for writing to citizens](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/sending-emails-and-text-messages).

### The sender

Letters are printed on letterhead. Emails and text messages should be sent from [HM Courts and Tribunals Service].


### Addressing users

In emails and letters, use:

>Dear First name Last name,

Unless there is another business need, do not ask users for their title. You don't need to address the user by name in a text message.

### Letter sign-off

For letters, unless citizens need to reply to a named person, sign off with:

>From,
>HM Courts and Tribunals Service


### Email sign-off

Keep this short and simple - it should never be longer than the message. If you have a contact us page in your service, direct users to it. It should have all the details and is a single place to make changes. Give citizens comfort by displaying the full link.

Our standard email sign-off is:

>From,
>HM Courts and Tribunals Service

>Please don't reply to this email. If you need to contact us, go to https://full-link/contact.

If users already have a reference, you could add a reminder to use it:

>Please don't reply to this email. If you need to contact us, go to https://full-link/contact. Remember to include your reference.
