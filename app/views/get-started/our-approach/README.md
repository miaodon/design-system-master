The reform programme understands user experience is key to delivery. The user experience team's ways of working are focussed on delivering better products for users by being __open__, __collaborative__ and __pragmatic__.

__Being open:__
 - our teams have visibility of our work and backlog and understand how it feeds into delivery
 - our service teams provide input to the focus, priority and direction of our work
 - we invest time to ensure our work has wider value across the Reform programme

__Being collaborative:__
 - we share a vision with our service teams for how UX supports delivery
 - we believe that for our colleagues to care about the work we do, we must care about what they do
 - we make sure our teams have regular opportunities to learn from and input to our work

__Being pragmatic:__
 - we prioritise making things better for our users over following the perfect process
 - we start with user needs and recognise we canâ€™t meet those needs without delivering
