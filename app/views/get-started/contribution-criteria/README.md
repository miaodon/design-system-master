As the HMCTS Design System is an extension of the GOV.UK Design System, the [contribution critera](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/) is the same.

The only difference is that it will be reviewed by the HMCTS Design team as opposed to the GOV.UK Design System working group.
