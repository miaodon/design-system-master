The Design System is built upon the research and experience of teams across the reform program.

Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones.

The [backlog](https://github.com/hmcts/design-system-backlog/issues) contains a list of components, patterns and updates. They can be:

* **Proposed** - someone has suggested a new component or pattern
* **To do** - the proposed component or pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on
* **In progress** - someone is actively working on the component or pattern
