To be __just__, we must be:
 - fair
 - transparent
 - equal

 __So, our services must:__
  - be optimised to work well, regardless of the device or channel used
  - be easy to find, easy to use and easy to use again
  - give users the information they need, when they need it, across the whole journey
  - clearly explain what is involved in the process
  - ensure users know where they are in the process, and what to expect next
